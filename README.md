# DjangoProject1

This is my third application project concluded for the Udemy's Advanced Django course. Nothing much to say: it's a responsive web application using Django's Class Based Views and having many of the content extracted from the database via modules.

There is a hosted version of it at https://fusion-marciomizu.herokuapp.com/ for quick view.
